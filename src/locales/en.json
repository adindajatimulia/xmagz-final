Researchers used 2,500 cough sounds of Covid-19 patients and 2,500 cough sounds of healthy individuals. Then, from the 5,000 samples, the researchers used 4,000 samples to train the AI ??algorithm. Meanwhile, 1,000 other samples were used to see whether the AI ??could detect it accurately or not.",
    "paragraph4": "Researchers say this technology is able to detect COVID-19 from symptomatic people with an accuracy rate of 98.5 percent. Meanwhile, the detection of covid-19 from OTG is said to have an accuracy rate of up to 100 percent only from coughing sounds. These researchers continue to claim that the cough of people exposed to Covid-19, be it those with symptoms or OTG, with the cough of an ordinary person actually has a different voice. This difference is said to be inaudible to the human ear, but can be captured by the AI ??technology that has been made.",
    "paragraph5": "As a continuation of this AI technology discovery, it is hoped that it can be developed into applications. The implementation of this application can reduce the spread of the Covid-19 virus if people use it before going to schools, factories, or restaurants. Brian said as quoted from Kompas Tekno."
